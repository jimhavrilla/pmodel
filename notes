notes

bill will mark/remove incomplete transcripts
bill will give the total domain count for pfamA

create ensembl file from original gtf file
**dedup based on auto_reg
create count for syn/non-syn muts from vcfs and add MAF

create this table after intersect mut:
domain	type (syn?)	MAF	# of occurrences	total bp
7tm_4 non-syn .01 100 2000
Ribosomal syn .001 10 100

defining non-synonymous:
	missense,missense-near-splice,stop-gained,stop-gained-near-splice,stop-lost
defining synonymous:
	coding,coding-notMod3,coding-synonymous,coding-synonymous-near-splice,codingComplex

make point size in dn/ds a function of the numerator (dn)
color points in dn/ds as a function of the median MAF
